add("EPIC: The Mystical Market pillar does not exist",
    "epic,market",
"""## Problem
`docs/plunderspell.md`'s mood board devotes a full pillar to the Mystical Market (the
Spellmonger's Stall, the Smith's Stall, the Alchemist's Stall, the Curiosity Dealer) with specific
rules: it always costs more than finding the same thing in a dungeon, it remembers what it's sold
a player, and whatever's left after the debt is settled is spent here. None of it exists in the
codebase - no scene, no shop UI, no stall data, nothing in `docs/systems/`.

## Context
This is separate from the 2026-09-16 playtesting backlog (#5-#25), which was filed against the
raid loop; the market sits at the lair, which that backlog never touched. See
`docs/plans/moodboard-gap-closure.md` §2.4.

## Done when
The three issues under this epic (market hub + UI, stall wares/pricing, mark-up + spend-leftover
rule) are closed, and a player can walk from the lair into the market, buy something with debt
already owed, and see it remembered on a later visit.""")

"""## Problem
There is nowhere in the game to spend gold on anything but the debt. No market scene, no shop
screen, no purchase flow.

## Context
The pitch (`docs/plunderspell.md`, "The Mystical Market" section) describes the market as bound to
the lair the same way the lair itself persists between sessions: "buy a thing once and it stays
bought, even for a fellow who wanders in a month from now, poorer than you and grateful for it."
`LairHubManager` already tracks debt and banked gold (`docs/systems/raid-scene-assembly.md`); a
market needs to read and write against the same persistent state.

## Acceptance criteria
- A market location or menu is reachable from the lair.
- Four stalls are represented (see the wares-content issue for what each sells).
- A purchase is deducted from banked gold and persists across sessions, per player.
- Re-entering the market shows what was already bought as already owned, not re-purchasable.""")

- Alchemist's Stall - one-use consumable potions and tonics
- Curiosity Dealer - gadgets, curios, upgrades of no fixed category

## Context
The eight spells are already fully defined (`Assets/_Project/Data/Spells/`), so "unlearned
incantations" likely means gating spells the player hasn't cast successfully yet behind a

assumed.

Debt payment already exists (`RaidDirector`/`ExtractionResolved` banks worth against the debt per

most of them currently don't).

## Context
See `docs/plans/moodboard-gap-closure.md` §2.5. The lair is also where the (currently nonexistent)
market lives - see the market epic - so building the lair as a place and building the market are
likely one body of work, not two.

`docs/systems/castle.md`, `alarm.md` or `raid.md` - the only hazard-adjacent system documented is
the generic noise/alarm escalation, which applies identically regardless of era.

## Context
Distinct from issue #17 ("Only one era has art and models"), which is about rooms/loot/enemies.
This is about era-specific *rules*, which need a hook into the castle/alarm/guard systems rather
than just more art. See `docs/plans/moodboard-gap-closure.md` §2.3.

allies, casts at range"), GildedColossus ("vault boss - asymmetric siege construct"). Nothing in
the pitch or mood board describes magical constructs, hovering casters or a swarming flier as
antagonists - the pitch's threat is explicitly and repeatedly human.

This is a creative-direction question, not a bug - flagged per the project's own instruction to
check in whenever work diverges from the mood-board vision. See

- Rework the five divergent enemies into the household-guard register the pitch promises (e.g. a
  retainer instead of ArcRevenant, a war-machine instead of HexTurret), or
- Update the pitch/mood board to admit a deliberate supernatural register the original text didn't

`GildedColossus` is rare by design (weight 2 in the Crypt only, ~2 appearances per 523 spawns per

"""## Problem
`docs/ProjectState.md` and `docs/Today.md` both already state this plainly: there is no
`BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer()` entry point anywhere in `Assets/` (reconfirmed by folder listing this
pass), so whether the project actually runs as a standalone build - outside the Unity Editor - is
unknown.

## Context
Filed because this fact was documented but had no GitHub issue tracking it as work to be done.

## Acceptance criteria
- A build pipeline entry point exists (menu item or CI script) that produces a standalone player.
- At least one successful standalone build is produced and smoke-tested (reaches the main menu,
  can start and complete a raid).""")

"""## Problem
A representative raid now instantiates 40-48 castle rooms (~12-15k triangles of modelled geometry,
per `docs/systems/raid-scene-assembly.md`'s verification numbers) plus up to ~19 loot pieces and a
full guard roster - but no frame-time, draw-call, or memory budget has ever been set or measured
against real hardware.

## Context
This becomes more urgent once the art-authoring items in this backlog land (three more eras' worth
of rooms/loot/enemies, VFX, particles) - better to establish a budget before tripling the asset
count than after.

## Acceptance criteria
- A frame-time/draw-call budget is defined for a representative raid.
- At least one profiling pass is run and recorded against it, with a clear pass/fail against the
  budget.""")

`docs/Roadmap.md` defines M2 done as "four real players complete a raid together, start to finish,
through the actual built game." `docs/ProjectState.md` already states this has never happened - 116
automated tests passing is explicitly called out as not the same thing. This item tracks the
actual playtest as work, separate from the 21-item punch list (#5-#25) that a first real session
would very likely surface more of.

## Acceptance criteria
- Four real people play a raid together, start to finish, on the actual built game.
- The outcome (completed / failed, and why) is recorded against the M2 acceptance criterion in
  `docs/ProjectState.md`.""")

An `Assets/_Project/Scripts/.../Settings` area is referenced in the project structure, but whether
it exposes audio mixer levels, key rebinding, or microphone device selection has not been checked

- Master/SFX/music mix levels are exposed and functional (this also depends on audio actually
  existing - see issue #18).
- Key bindings are rebindable, including every spell word's keyboard-mock binding.
- Microphone device is selectable, with a visible indicator of which device is active.""")

"""## Problem
The pitch states plainly that voice is never required: "every word can also be bound to a key...
nobody is locked out for being mute, or shy, or awake at three in the morning in a thin-walled
house" (§4). What exists today (`MockVoiceInputService`, per `docs/systems/voice.md`) is a
dev/editor/headless fallback, auto-selected when no real recognizer is available - not a real,
player-facing accessibility *option* a person can deliberately choose in a shipped build with a
working microphone.

## Context
`VoiceServiceLocator`'s selection order (editor/headless/no-mic -> mock, else Vosk) has no path for
"a player with a working mic chooses keyboard casting anyway." That's a settings/accessibility
feature, not just a fallback.

## Acceptance criteria
- A settings toggle lets a player choose keyboard casting even when a working microphone is
  available.
- Each of the 40-word lexicon's words has a clear, documented, rebindable key.""")

add("The pitch's six reference lighting frames have no concept art or lighting targets",

"""## Problem
`docs/plunderspell.md` §9 names six specific lighting frames as a production target: the Lair, the
Treasury, the Portal, the Hue & Cry, the Approach, and a Bronze Age Interior - each with a one-line
mood description. None have concept art, a defined lighting rig, or even an agreed camera setup to
check "did we hit this" against.

## Context
Issue #19 ("Castles look bland") will address material/lighting quality generically, but three of
the six frames (Lair, Portal, Approach) aren't castle interiors at all, so #19 closing won't
produce any of them. This item exists to make the six frames a trackable deliverable rather than
prose in the pitch nobody is aiming at directly.

## Acceptance criteria
- Each of the six frames has at least a lighting-reference pass (concept sketch, or an in-engine
  reference shot) that can be compared against its one-line mood description.

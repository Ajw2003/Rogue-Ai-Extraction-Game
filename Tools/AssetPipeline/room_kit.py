"""
Shared bmesh helpers for Plunderspell castle/level modules, layered on
mesh_kit's primitives the same way builders.py stacks them for props.

Runs only inside Blender's Python (imports bpy/bmesh/mathutils via mesh_kit).

Every module is authored bottom-flush (lowest vertex at local Z=0) and
centred on the local X/Y origin, sized to sit inside the ~12m grid cell
ProceduralCastleGenerator places modules on (see `cellSize` in
ProceduralCastleGenerator.cs) with a small seam so two placed modules'
outer walls never sit flush and z-fight.

Doors are left as gaps in a wall run built from up to three box segments
(two jambs + a lintel over the opening) rather than a boolean cut — same
"stack primitives" approach as every prop builder, and it keeps the result
trivially manifold and quad-dominant.

add("PCG: rooms do not connect and the floor plan does not read as a castle",
    "pcg,bug",
"""Reported as item 1.

## Problem
The generated layout does not play as a castle. Rooms are placed on the grid but adjacent modules
do not line up into connected interior space, and the resulting flow (crypt outward to extraction)
is not legible or interesting to move through.

## Context
`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Runtime/Castle/ProceduralCastleGenerator.cs` places modules on concentric
Chebyshev rings, attaching each to an already-placed 4-neighbour. That guarantees the *metadata*
layout is 4-connected (and `CastlePathValidator` passes), but says nothing about whether the
*meshes* form connected rooms:

- Rooms are 11.2 m in a 12 m cell, so there is a ~0.8 m gap between every pair of neighbours.
- `CastleRoomModule` prefabs carry `SocketPoint` children, but the generator places by grid cell and
  never matches sockets. Several modules have 0, 1 or 2 sockets (`Bastion`, `WallCorner` and
  `WallStraight` have none), so door openings are not guaranteed to face a neighbour.
- Ring candidate cells that fail the "has a placed neighbour" test are skipped, which is what leaves
  the scattered, disconnected look.

Closely related to the floating/spacing issue; likely fixed together but tracked separately because
the acceptance criteria differ.

## Acceptance criteria
- Adjacent placed modules share a wall or a doorway; no unintended gap between neighbours.
- Socket matching (or an equivalent rule) drives placement so an opening always faces an opening.
- A player can walk from the crypt chamber to the extraction exit entirely through interior space.
- The existing `CastleGeneratorTests` determinism and reachability tests still pass.""")

add("Player is too tall for the rooms (scale mismatch between character and architecture)",
    "gameplay,bug",
"""Reported as item 2.

## Problem
The player capsule is too tall relative to room interiors, so the castle reads as cramped and
doorways/ceilings do not fit a human-scale character.

## Context
- Player is built in `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/RaidSceneBuilder.cs`: `PlayerHeight = 2f`,
  `PlayerRadius = 0.4f`, `EyeHeight = 1.6f`.
- Measured room outer heights (renderer world bounds) by zone:
  Crypt 2.9 m, OuterBailey 3.5 m, InnerWard 4.1 m, Keep 4.9 m, CurtainWall 6.1 m.
  Those include floor and roof thickness, so usable interior is lower still.
- Enemy heights for comparison: Watchman 1.78 m, VaultWarden 2.38 m, GildedColossus 3.41 m. The
  Colossus does not fit in a crypt room at all.

## Acceptance criteria
- Decide the canonical metre scale for a character and record it in `docs/systems/`.
- Player, enemies and room interiors agree on that scale; the Colossus fits where it can spawn.
- Doorway heights clear the player with headroom.""")

There is no aiming reticle, so spell targeting and loot interaction are guesswork.

There is nothing obviously carryable in the world, and picking loot up does not read as available.

Loot *is* spawning - a raid places ~19 pieces across all five authored prefabs (CopperPot,

two-person carry for heavy items. Two things make it unusable in practice:
1. Pieces are physically small (a goblet is 0.10 x 0.19 x 0.11 m) and scattered at room centres.

add("Modules float and snap inconsistently - grid spacing must be exact",

"""Reported as item 15.

## Problem
Structures connect and disconnect between seeds, and some sit at heights they should not. Placement
should land on an exact grid, not approximately.

## Context
`ProceduralCastleGenerator` uses `cellSize = 12f` and places at
`new Vector3(cell.x * cellSize, 0f, cell.y * cellSize)`, so the *origin* spacing is exact - but:
- Room meshes are 11.2 m wide in a 12 m cell, so there is a systematic ~0.8 m gap at every join.
- Module footprints are not uniform: `Drawbridge` is 11.2 x 19.8 m and `WallCorner` is 12.3 x 12.4 m,
  so they cannot tile a 12 m grid the way the others do.
- Room heights vary by zone (2.9 m to 9.7 m) with no rule for how a taller module meets a shorter one.

Room roots now sit correctly at y = 0 after the orientation fix (verified: 38/38 rooms with
`minY ~= 0`), so any remaining floating is placement, not the prefab transforms.

## Acceptance criteria

- Neighbouring modules touch with no gap.

add("Loot is flung across the map by physics at spawn",
    "physics,bug",
"""Reported as item 16 (which proposes the fix), and found independently while wiring the authored
loot prefabs.

## Problem
Spawned loot is ejected hard by PhysX and ends up in the air or outside the world, instead of
resting where it was placed.

## Measured
Pieces outside a sane y range (below -0.5 m or above 12 m) after a raid settles:

| Configuration | Out of position |
|---|---|
| Baseline (current) | 7 / 19 |
| `ScatterRadius` 3 m -> 1 m | 5 / 18 |
| Raycast-for-floor settling (reverted) | 15 / 22 - **worse** |

Worst observed positions: y = -1945 (falling forever) and y = +33.

## Cause
`LootPlacementPlanner` is a **pure** function by design - deterministic, no scene access, so every
peer derives the same haul from the replicated seed. It therefore knows a room's centre but not the
shape of its mesh, and places loot 0.5 m above the room origin scattered up to 3 m. Against the old
flat placeholder floor that was always safe; against real room geometry a piece can spawn inside a
wall or a prop, and a rigidbody created overlapping a collider is depenetrated at speed. Reducing
scatter barely helped, which means props at the room centre are the dominant cause.

An earlier attempt to raycast for the floor made it worse by landing loot on room roofs, and was
reverted.

`Physics.SyncTransforms()` is already called in `LootSpawner.SpawnFor` before spawning, because the
rooms are instantiated in the same frame and PhysX does not otherwise see their colliders.

## Proposed fix (from the report)
Spawn loot kinematic / with physics disabled for ~0.5 s, then hand it to physics, so PhysX never
sees an overlapping body at creation. Note `LootPickup` already manages `isKinematic` for carrying
and nothing currently un-freezes placed loot, so this needs an explicit release rather than just
spawning kinematic.

## Constraints
- `LootPlacementPlanner` must stay pure and deterministic; any scene probing belongs in `LootSpawner`.
- `RogueAi.Tests.RaidLoopTests` covers plan/spawn agreement and must keep passing.

## Acceptance criteria
- 0 of ~19 pieces out of position across several seeds.
- Loot rests visibly on a surface inside its room.
- Determinism tests still pass.""")

problem and as solution.

## Problem
There is no game. The systems exist and are individually tested, but nothing joins them into a loop

## Target loop
Lair -> set out -> enter the castle -> find and pick up loot -> be found by enemies and fight or
evade -> carry the haul to the portal -> extract -> return to the lair -> takings pay down the debt
-> set out again, deeper.

## What already works
- Menu -> lair -> Set Out -> raid -> back to the lair on resolve.
- Seed-deterministic castle, loot placement and garrison, all built from authored art.
- Guards hear, see, investigate and chase; the alarm escalates Calm -> Stirred -> Roused -> HueAndCry.
- Loot has worth, bulk and fragility; heavy items need two people; extraction tallies worth and
  applies it to the debt.
- Push-to-cast resolves eight spells including misfires.

## What is missing before the loop is playable
Each is tracked separately; this issue is done when they are:
- Combat that can be won or lost - health and damage, and feedback for both.
- Loot that can be found and picked up without fighting the physics.
- A castle you can actually walk through - connectivity and grid spacing.
- A portal to extract through.
- Feedback: animation, VFX, SFX, crosshair, locked cursor.

## Acceptance criteria

# Today

**2026-09-18 — Phase 1 verification pass.** Worked `Plans/Priority_Queue.md` Phase 1 in order,
checking each issue against the code rather than against its plan, on branch
`claude/playable-loop-fixes`.

## Done

- **Resolved the two plan documents disagreeing.** `Plans/Priority_Queue.md` (later, and written
  against "get each individual feature completed first to see if the game is fun mechanically
  before doing any more artwork") is the live order; `docs/plans/playable-state-backlog.md` is
  marked superseded for ordering and kept as the issue map. Its 55 per-issue plan links all pointed
  at `docs/plans/issues/`, which does not exist — the plans are in `Plans/`. Relinked, and `Plans/`
  is now in `docs/README.md`'s moving-parts table.
- **Fixed issue 9 on the component the raid actually uses.** It had been implemented against
  `FreeLookPlaytestController`, which is not in `RaidScene.unity` — the raid carries
  `PlayerStateMachine` + `PlayerInputController`, which had no gate at all. See `docs/Decisions.md`,
  "Issue 9's gate belongs on the raid's player, not only on the playtest harness".
- **Closed 5 issues on evidence**, not on a code read: #5, #9, #19, #20, #25. 55 open → 50.
- Regenerated the 13-image castle screenshot set as the visual evidence behind #5/#19/#25.

## Verified, on this machine

Unity 6000.3.15f1 batchmode: compile exit 0 with zero `error CS`; EditMode 12/12; PlayMode 117/118.
The one PlayMode failure (`Test_TheCursorFollowsTheGameStateAndIsFreedByLosingFocus`) was confirmed
to fail identically on unmodified HEAD — `Cursor.lockState` cannot be `Locked` with no interactive
window. It is a batchmode artifact and should not be read as a red suite.

## Deliberately not closed

- **#7 (crosshair)** and **#8 (cursor lock)** are both implemented and both unverifiable headlessly
  — IMGUI is invisible to `Camera.Render()`, and cursor lock needs a real window. They need one
  interactive play session, not more code.
- **#15 (loot discoverable)** — `LootHighlight` works and #20 is fixed, but the discoverability
  claim is visual and no capture of the focused-vs-unfocused state was made.
- **#6 (player too tall)** — only partial evidence (clear headroom under the archway at 1.65m eye
  height in `seed-12345-eye.png`); not measured against every room type.

## Surfaced, not today's job

- **`ItemGym.unity` cannot currently be used as a combat bench** (#18): nothing in it reaches
  `GameState.Playing`, so the gated body cannot move until the bootstrapped Main Menu → Lair →
  Descend route is walked, and no enemy prefab is in the scene to swing at.
- **`EditorBuildSettings` lists only `TestScene`** — `RaidScene` is not in the build list, so #53
  is more than "nobody pressed Build".
- **#37 melee only fires when the player has no `SpellBook`** — `PlayerStateMachine.Attack()` casts
  a spell if one is present and never reaches `TryMeleeSwing`.

---

**2026-09-16 — documentation audit day.** No gameplay code changed. `main` had gained the
raid-scene-assembly work, the menu → lair → raid flow, the castle orientation fix and a 21-issue
playtesting backlog since anyone last touched `docs/`, and `docs/` itself had tier 4
(`docs/systems/`) and `docs/plans/` but no tier 1, 2, 3, 5 or 6, and no `archive/` or `generated/`.

## Done

- Found `origin/claude/repo-status-check-hjp6z7`: an unmerged branch that had already written
  tiers 1, 2, 3, 5 and three missing tier-4 docs (`voice.md`, `castle.md`, `alarm.md`), cut from a
  point 11 commits behind current `main`. Adopted its tier-4 work as-is (the systems it covers
  hadn't changed) and rewrote the rest for what's shipped since. See `docs/Decisions.md`'s first
  entry for the full reasoning.
- Wrote tier 6 (`docs/Decisions.md`) from scratch — 8 real, dated decisions mined from commit
  history and the existing plan/system docs, none invented.
- Added `docs/systems/raid-scene-assembly.md` to the tier-4 index (`docs/systems/README.md`) — it
  already existed on `main` but was never indexed.
- Created `docs/generated/` and moved the three standalone HTML previews
  (`castle-generator-visualization.html`, `plunderspell-moodboard.html`, `ui-preview.html`) into
  it from the `docs/` root, plus the live GitHub-issues manifest
  (`.agent_reports/github-issues.json` → `docs/generated/github-issues.json`), updating
  `Tools/mkissues.py`'s output path and every cross-reference into the moved files.
- Moved the remaining `.agent_reports/` paper trail (the 2026-09-15 branch-integration narrative
  and test results — the docs-scaffold branch had already moved these on its own copy, but that
  branch was never merged so `main` still had the original `.agent_reports/` at the repo root)
  into `docs/archive/2026-09-15-integration/`, with the same "not actually committed" correction
  to `FINAL_MERGE_SUMMARY.md`'s self-reference that the abandoned branch had already worked out.
- Updated `docs/ProjectState.md`: the raid now runs on real authored art rather than primitives,
  the menu/lair/raid flow is live, and the 2026-09-16 issue backlog (21 open items, verified live
  via `gh issue list`) is now the concrete evidence behind M2's "acceptance unchecked" status.
- Fixed the one real drift already known from the abandoned branch: `docs/plans/plunderspell.md`'s
  own "Status" section still said "Planning complete; no implementation yet" despite M0–M3 having
  merged weeks ago. Pointed it at `docs/ProjectState.md` instead.
- Added a pointer from the project's `CLAUDE.md` to `docs/README.md`.

## Deliberately not done

- Did not write per-file doc comments or touch any `.cs` file beyond the two path corrections
  above (`Tools/mkissues.py`'s output directory) — this was a documentation-structure pass, not a
  code-quality pass.
- Did not attempt to verify M1/M2's acceptance criteria myself (real-microphone accent testing, a
  real four-player session), and did not triage the 21 open GitHub issues individually — both need
  a human (and, for the issues, actual engineering time), not a docs pass. Flagged as unchecked /
  open in `docs/ProjectState.md` instead of guessing at status.

## Surfaced, not today's job

- `docs/ProjectState.md` → "Choosing an era does nothing to the raid you get" — still true,
  re-verified by grep this pass. `CastleRoomRegistry` has no era field, so M3 needs a data-model
  change before it can produce era-specific content.
- The 21-issue playtesting backlog (`docs/generated/github-issues.json`, GitHub issues #5–#25) is
  a real, current punch list — #20 (loot physics fling) and #5/#19 (room connectivity/floating
  modules) are the ones most likely to block a real four-player playtest of M2's acceptance
  criterion.
- No real Unity Editor player build has ever been produced for this project — reconfirmed by grep
  (`BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer` appears nowhere in `Assets/`). Whether it actually runs as a
  standalone build is still unknown.

## Next, in order

1. Triage the 21 open GitHub issues against the milestones in `docs/Roadmap.md` — several (loot
   fling, room connectivity, player spawn placement) block a credible M2 playtest; others (VFX/SFX,
   menu art) don't block the loop but do block "something you'd hand a friend."
2. Get an actual four-player raid played start to finish and record what happened, rather than
   relying on the automated PlayMode suite as a stand-in for "is this fun" — same for M1's
   real-microphone, multi-accent recognition measurement.
3. Only after 1–2: decide the `CastleRoomRegistry`/loot/guard schema change M3 actually needs.

## Later, same day — moodboard gap-closure pass

A second pass, requested directly: audit the built game against `docs/plunderspell.md` and the
mood board pillar by pillar (not against the raid loop, which the morning's 21-item backlog
already covers), write up the findings, and file GitHub issues for everything needed to close the
gap — "exhaustive," including content that has no art or systems work behind it yet at all.

### Done

- Read the pitch bible, the mood board, every tier-3/4/5/6 doc, and walked `Assets/`,
  `Assets/_Project/{Art,Data,Prefabs,Scripts}` and `Tools/` on disk (folder-listing depth, not a
  line-by-line code read — see the plan doc's "What this pass did not check").
- Wrote up the full findings, pillar by pillar, as
  [`docs/plans/moodboard-gap-closure.md`](plans/moodboard-gap-closure.md).
- Filed 34 new GitHub issues via `Tools/mkissues_moodboard_gap.py`, following the same
  `gh issue create` mechanism as `Tools/mkissues.py`; manifest at
  `docs/generated/github-issues-moodboard-gap.json` once run.
- Pointed `docs/README.md` and `docs/ProjectState.md` at the new plan doc and backlog.

### Deliberately not done

- Did not open individual `.cs` scripts or `.asset` YAML to verify implementation details beyond
  what the existing tier-4 docs already cite — flagged explicitly in the plan doc rather than
  presented as more thoroughly checked than it was.
- Did not resolve the one open creative-direction question the audit surfaced (the bestiary's
  thematic split between household guards and arcane/fantasy enemies) — that needs a human
  decision, not more analysis; filed as its own issue with a `decision-needed` label rather than
  guessed at.
- Did not run `Tools/mkissues_moodboard_gap.py` against the real repo — this cloud session has no
  `gh` authentication or GitHub write path. The script was dry-run twice against a mocked `gh` to
  validate its logic (34 issues, no duplicate titles, every label it uses gets created first, valid
  JSON manifest written) but the actual `gh issue create` calls are untested until run locally.

### Surfaced, not today's job

- The Mystical Market (the pitch's fourth named pillar) doesn't exist in the codebase at all — not
  a raid-loop gap, a whole unbuilt system. See the plan doc §2.4.
- The Lair is built as a UI screen, not the 3D "damp, yours, and permanent" place the pitch
  describes. See the plan doc §2.5.

### Next, in order

1. Run `Tools/mkissues_moodboard_gap.py` locally (where `gh` is already authenticated) to actually
   file the 34 issues.
2. Decide the bestiary question (its own filed issue) before any more art/animation/audio work
   lands on the five divergent enemies — reworking them later is more expensive than deciding once.
3. Interleave the new backlog with the existing 21-item one per
   `docs/plans/moodboard-gap-closure.md` §4's suggested triage order.

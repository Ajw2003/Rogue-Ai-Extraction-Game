# Raid scene assembly

How `Assets/_Project/Scenes/RaidScene.unity` comes to hold the castle, the haul and the garrison —
and which authored assets it is assembled from.

This document exists because the scene used to be assembled from *nothing*: `RaidSceneBuilder`
generated its own box room, its own gold cube and its own capsule guard, so none of the modelled art
in the project ever appeared in a raid. See "The placeholder era" below.

Owns: `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/RaidSceneBuilder.cs`,
`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/EnemyPrefabForge.cs`,
`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/RaidLootTableForge.cs`,
`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/CastleMeshImportSettings.cs`,
`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Runtime/Raid/EnemyRoster.cs`,
`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Runtime/Castle/CastleNavMeshBaker.cs`.

## How it works

Three authored catalogues feed the scene. Each is a committed asset, editable by hand; none is
generated at runtime.

| Catalogue | Asset | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Rooms | `Data/Castle/CastleRoomRegistry.asset` | 25 room prefabs, 5 per zone |
| Loot | `Data/Loot/RaidLootTable.asset` | 9 postings over 5 loot prefabs |
| Enemies | `Data/Enemies/EnemyRoster.asset` | 18 postings over 10 enemy prefabs |

**`Tools/Plunderspell/Build Playable Raid Scene`** wires those three into a scene and saves it. It
places no geometry of its own beyond a ground plane, a light and the extraction pad — every mesh in a
raid comes from a prefab built from a `.blend`. If any catalogue is missing the build aborts and
names all of them, rather than falling back to primitives.

**`Tools/Plunderspell/Forge Enemy Prefabs + Roster`** authors one prefab per model in
`Assets/Models/Enemies/` and the roster that posts them. Each prefab is a **variant of the model**,
not a copy, so re-exporting the `.blend` flows through to the prefab. Onto that variant it adds a
`CapsuleCollider` and `NavMeshAgent` sized from the model's measured bounds, a
`StatusEffectReceiver`, and a `CastleGuard` tuned per role. The tuning table lives in
`EnemyPrefabForge.Specs`; the roles it is derived from are recorded in
`Assets/Models/Enemies/enemy_manifest.json`.

**`Tools/Plunderspell/Forge Raid Loot Table`** pairs the five loot prefabs with the zones they are
found in. Worth climbs inward — Copper Pot (15) at the wall, Ancient Relic (500) in the crypt — so
the long carry out is what the valuable things cost.

### Enemy postings

Every zone draws from a mix, with the common soldiery outside and the rare, dangerous things deep:

| Zone | Roster |
|---|---|
| CurtainWall | Watchman (12), HexTurret (4) |
| OuterBailey | Watchman (10), ManAtArms (8), WarHound (6) |
| InnerWard | ManAtArms (8), Sergeant (5), WarHound (6), SigilWisp (5) |
| Keep | Sergeant (5), SigilWisp (4), VaultWarden (6), HexTurret (3), ArcRevenant (3) |
| Crypt | VaultWarden (5), ArcRevenant (5), CryptRisen (12), GildedColossus (2) |

`GuardPlacementPlanner` still decides *how many* guards stand *where* and what they walk; the roster
only answers *which one*, from a fourth seed-derived RNG stream (`seed * 31 + 24593`) so picking an
enemy cannot shift the castle, the loot, or where the garrison stands.

### Navigation

The castle is instantiated from the seed at runtime, so its NavMesh is built at runtime too. A bake
done in the Editor would only ever cover the empty ground plane.

`RaidDirector.BuildCastle` calls `CastleNavMeshBaker.Rebuild()` in the one window where it works:
**after** the rooms are instantiated and **before** the garrison spawns. A guard spawned before the
bake lands off-mesh and stands still for the entire raid.

`CastleMeshImportSettings` forces Read/Write on everything under `Art/Models/Castle/`, because
`NavMeshSurface` has to read those meshes to bake them. It is an `AssetPostprocessor` rather than a
one-off pass so that re-exporting a `.blend` cannot quietly undo it.

### Orientation

The models come from Blender (Z-up) into Unity (Y-up), and the three prefab families do **not** agree
on where that correction lives. This was measured by instantiating each prefab at candidate rotations
and reading world bounds, not reasoned about:

| Family | Root rotation | Upright when instantiated with |
|---|---|---|
| Castle rooms | `(90,0,0)` (repaired) | the prefab's own root rotation |
| Loot | `(270,0,0)` | the prefab's own root rotation |
| Enemies | identity (correction on mesh child) | the prefab's own root rotation |

The castle prefabs were originally saved with a root of `(270,0,0)` *on top of* their mesh child's
own `(270,0,0)`, which composes to a 180-degree flip about X — the room hangs below the floor.
`Tools/Plunderspell/Fix Castle Prefab Orientation` sets those roots to `(90,0,0)`.

Because every family is now upright at its own root rotation, the rule at every spawn site is the
same: **compose with `prefab.transform.rotation`, never replace it.** `Instantiate(prefab, pos, rot,
parent)` overwrites the root rotation, which is what laid every room on its edge.

### Getting into a raid

The raid no longer starts on scene load. The flow is
**Main menu -> Lair -> Set Out -> raid -> back to the Lair**:

- `MainMenuScreen`'s Play goes to `GameState.Lair`, not straight to `Playing`.
- `LairScreen` shows the debt, the banked gold and the four eras, and reads `LairHubManager`
  directly. Set Out moves to `GameState.Playing`.
- `RaidBootstrapper` listens for that transition and calls `RaidDirector.StartRaid()`, taking the
  era from the lair. It ignores Paused/Inventory -> Playing, which are returns, not departures.
- When `RaidDirector.RaidResolved` fires, the bootstrapper puts the game back in `GameState.Lair`
  so the takings land against the debt.
- `_autoStart` still exists on `RaidBootstrapper` but defaults to **false**. Turn it on to skip the
  menu while iterating on the raid itself.

`RaidHudView` only draws in `Playing`, `Paused` or `Inventory`. It is IMGUI, which renders over the
uGUI canvas, so an always-on HUD sits on top of the menu and the lair.

## Invariants

- **The scene is assembled from authored assets or not at all.** `RaidSceneBuilder` aborts when a
  catalogue is missing. The silent fallback to primitives is what hid the problem for so long.
- **Enemy prefabs are variants of their model.** Never copies — a copy severs the link to the
  `.blend` and the art stops flowing through.
- **Every zone has at least one enemy posting and one loot posting.** A zone with an empty pool
  spawns nothing there, silently.
- **The NavMesh is baked between castle generation and guard spawning.** Not in `Start()`, not
  in the Editor.
- **Spawn sites compose with the prefab's rotation, never replace it.** Passing a bare rotation to
  `Instantiate` discards the Blender axis correction the prefab root carries.
- **Castle models are Read/Write enabled.** An unreadable mesh still bakes in the Editor and
  silently produces no surface in a player build.

## Traps

- **Loot can be thrown by its own spawn.** `LootPlacementPlanner` is pure, so it knows a room's
  centre but not the shape of the room's mesh. It spawns loot 0.5 m above the room origin, scattered
  up to 3 m. Against the old flat placeholder floor that was always safe; against real room geometry
  a piece can spawn *inside* a wall or a prop, and PhysX ejects an overlapping rigidbody hard.
  Measured on seed-varied runs: roughly **2–7 of ~19 pieces** per raid end up flung into the air or
  out of the world. This is a pre-existing defect that the real art made visible; it is **not fixed**.
  Reducing `ScatterRadius` from 3 m to 1 m only moved it from 7/19 to 5/18, so the dominant cause is
  props at the room centre, not the scatter. A proper fix needs the spawner to find a clear resting
  spot (the planner must stay pure), and should be done with that constraint in mind — an earlier
  attempt that raycast for the floor made it *worse* (15/22) by landing loot on room roofs.

- **`GameServices` is initialised after scene `OnEnable`.** `UIBootstrapper` calls
  `GameServices.Initialize()` from `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(AfterSceneLoad)]`, which runs
  *later* than the `Awake`/`OnEnable` of objects already in the scene. Anything in a scene that
  touches `GameServices` from `OnEnable` must call `Initialize()` itself first — it is idempotent.
  Not doing so threw a NullReferenceException that silently ate the whole menu-to-raid transition.

- **Play mode does not tick while the Editor is unfocused.** `Application.runInBackground` is now on
  in Player Settings, but the Editor still needs `unity command set_autotick --enable true` to run
  frames while being driven from the CLI. Without it a driven Play session sits at frame 1 forever
  and every "nothing spawned" reading is a lie.

- **PhysX does not see a new collider until transforms are synced.** The rooms are instantiated and
  the loot is spawned in the same frame, so `LootSpawner.SpawnFor` calls `Physics.SyncTransforms()`
  first. Without it, queries run against an empty physics scene.

- **Room centres have no floor collider.** A downward ray from a room's centre passes through the
  room and hits the ground plane at y = 0. The room prefabs are shells; the ground plane is the
  floor. Anything probing for "the floor of this room" needs to know that.

- **`AssetDatabase.GenerateUniqueAssetPath` is not idempotent.** `RaidSceneBuilder` used it to save
  generated assets, so every re-run minted `GeneratedLootTable 1.asset`, `… 2.asset` and left the
  scene pointing at the original. It now overwrites a fixed path instead. The stale duplicates still
  in `Data/Generated/` are from that era.

- **`GildedColossus` is genuinely rare.** Weight 2 in the Crypt only; it appeared twice in 523 spawns
  across 40 seeds. That is intended for a vault boss, but it means a spot-check of one raid will
  usually not contain one.

## The placeholder era

Before this, `RaidSceneBuilder` generated everything it needed at build time: a `GeneratedRoomRegistry`
whose only entry was a primitive box room used for all five zones, a `GeneratedLootTable` of five
identical gold cubes, and a capsule `CastleGuard` with no `NavMeshAgent` — so the garrison could not
have moved even if a NavMesh had existed, and none did.

Meanwhile the project already contained 25 modelled castle rooms wired into a complete
`CastleRoomRegistry`, 5 modelled loot prefabs with colliders and `LootPickup` data, and 10 rigged
enemy models. None of it was referenced by anything. The builder's own doc comment described this as
intentional ("Everything it generates is placeholder… a harness for playing the game, not the art
pass") — the harness simply outlived the art arriving.

## Verification

Driven against a live Editor through the Unity CLI pipeline package (`unity command …`). On a
representative raid:

- 40–48 castle rooms instantiated, ~12–15k triangles of modelled geometry
- all 5 loot prefabs present; all 10 enemy prefabs reachable across 40 seeds (523 spawns)
- every spawned enemy on the NavMesh (13/13, 12/12, 15/15 on separate runs)
- same seed twice produces an identical garrison
- 116/116 tests pass (12 EditMode, 104 PlayMode)

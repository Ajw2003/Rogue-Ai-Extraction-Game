# Castle

Builds the fortress a raid happens in, from a single seed, identically on every machine. If this
is wrong, either the game can't agree on a floor plan across the network, or it traps a party
inside a building with no way out.

## What it owns

Deterministic layout generation, verifying that layout is walkable, replicating just the seed
across the network, and the door/lockdown state the alarm drives. It does not decide what loot or
guards go where (`raid.md` — `LootPlacementPlanner`/`GuardPlacementPlanner` consume the layout
this produces) and it does not decide when to escalate (`AlarmFSMManager`, see `alarm.md`) —
`CastleLockdown` only reacts to that state.

## How it works

- **`ProceduralCastleGenerator.Generate(seed)`** builds a closed curtain wall around a dense block
  of concentric wards. The outer Chebyshev ring at `m_curtainWallRadius` (4 by default, so the
  castle is 9 cells / 108 m across) is filled completely: a `WallCorner` drum at each of the four
  turns, a `Bastion` every `m_bastionSpacing` cells along the runs, exactly one `GatehouseModule`
  on the +X axis cell with its `Drawbridge` in the cell immediately outside, and `WallStraight`
  everywhere else. Everything inside that ring is enclosed rooms, zoned by radius — `Crypt` at the
  origin, then `Keep`, `InnerWard`, `OuterBailey` — filled to `m_interiorFillFraction` (0.9, giving
  ~44 rooms) with the remainder left open as courtyards. A `System.Random` seeded once at the top
  drives every decision — never `UnityEngine.Random`, whose global static state is shared with
  VFX/audio and would make generation order-dependent (see `plunderspell.md` §7).
- **Courtyards are carved, not grown.** Candidate cells are shuffled by the seeded RNG and removed
  one at a time, each removal kept only if a flood fill shows the remaining interior is still a
  single 4-connected region. The origin (the path's start) and the cell inward of the gate (its
  end) are never candidates. That is what guarantees the A* validator can always walk out.
- **Wall pieces face outward, and that is not the same rotation as a room.** `build_wall_straight`
  in `Tools/AssetPipeline/castle_builders.py` raises its wall on the module's *south* side, which
  lands on local −Z after the Blender Z-up correction, so `RotationForOutwardWall` yaws the module
  until local −Z points away from the castle — the opposite of `RotationForFacing`, which points a
  room *toward* its anchor. `build_wall_corner` raises south *and* west, so unrotated its two faces
  cover the south-west pair; `RotationForCorner` yaws by that piece's south face, which carries the
  west face onto the corner's other outward side.
- **`CastlePathValidator.ValidatePath`** rasterises every placed module into a walkable grid at
  `CellScale`×`CellScale` resolution per layout cell (so adjacent modules' footprints touch and
  stay 4-connected) and runs a 4-directional A* from the crypt start to the extraction exit. This
  runs once at generation time, never per-frame.
- **`CastleNetworkManager`** is the only thing that crosses the network: the seed, as a PurrNet
  `SyncVar<int>`. Every peer's `OnSeedChanged` handler calls the same deterministic `Generate`
  locally — no mesh, module list, or transform is ever sent. If a layout fails validation, the
  server retries with `seed + 1` (not a fresh random number) up to `maxRetries`, so the seed it
  finally replicates is the one every client independently reproduces.
- **Doorways and door plugs.** Every enclosed room module is authored with an archway on all four
  sides (`_shell` in `Tools/AssetPipeline/castle_builders.py`). The generator places modules on the
  grid without consulting their geometry, so a room with archways on only some sides would sooner
  or later meet its neighbour archway-to-blank-wall. Opening all four makes every 4-adjacency a
  real connection regardless of rotation. The cost is that a room on the edge of the block has
  openings facing nothing, so `SealOpenArchways` runs after placement and plugs every archway that
  does not lead into another enclosed room — including archways onto a curtain-wall cell, which is
  a wall and not somewhere to walk. The single exception is the gatehouse cell, which is the way
  out. Plugs come from `CastleRoomRegistry.GetDoorPlugForZone` (authored by `CastleDoorPlugForge`),
  one per enclosed zone because the archway size is derived from the zone's wall height — see
  `scale.md` ("Archways").
- **The gatehouse is the extraction exit.** `AssignExtractionExit` marks it, so `ExtractionExitIndex`
  points at a `CurtainWall` module rather than an `OuterBailey` room. `LootPlacementPlanner` and
  `GuardPlacementPlanner` both skip that index, and the raid starts there too — see `scale.md`
  ("Spawning").
- **`CastleLockdown`** subscribes to `AlarmState` and locks (`Roused`) then bars (`HueAndCry`)
  every door — deliberately one-way, matching the alarm's own latch, so the castle can't hand back
  a mistake the players already paid for.

## Invariants

- **A raid never starts in a castle the crypt can't reach the exit from.** Generation is retried
  (seed walked forward, not re-rolled from scratch) until `CastlePathValidator` passes; see
  `raid.md`'s "A raid never starts in a castle you cannot walk out of."
- **Only the seed is ever sent over the network.** Generation must stay a pure function of it —
  any source of nondeterminism inside `Generate` (wall-clock time, `UnityEngine.Random`, iteration
  order over an unordered collection) breaks every client's ability to agree on the same building.
- **Lockdown only ever gets stricter.** `CastleLockdown` has no path back to unlocked; it mirrors
  `AlarmFSMManager`'s own latch at `Roused`.

- **Two 4-adjacent enclosed rooms are always door-connected, and no archway opens into empty
  space.** The first half comes from every room opening on all four sides, the second from
  `SealOpenArchways`. `CastleGeneratorTests.Test_AdjacentRoomsAreDoorConnected` holds both.
- **The curtain wall is a closed loop.** Every cell on the outer ring perimeter carries a
  `CurtainWall` module and there is exactly one gatehouse, for every seed.
  `Test_CurtainWallIsAClosedLoop` holds it.
- **The interior stays one 4-connected region and stays playable.** Courtyards are only carved
  where connectivity survives, and `Test_InteriorRoomCountIsPlayable` keeps the room count in
  40-60 so the castle is neither a corridor nor a city.
- **A module never leaves its grid cell.** `room_kit.FOOTPRINT` equals
  `ProceduralCastleGenerator.cellSize` (12 m) exactly, and `validate_in_blender` fails the asset
  build for any castle module whose XY bounding box reaches past ±6.05 m. Without that gate a
  module quietly grows into its neighbour's cell, which is what issue 19 was.

## Traps

- **The layout depends on whether a registry is assigned.** `PickWeighted` consumes a random draw
  when there is a room pool and returns early without one when there is not, so the same seed
  produces a different castle with and without prefabs. Compare two layouts only when both
  generators have the same registry.
- **`UnityEngine.Random` anywhere in the generation path is a silent multiplayer desync,** not a
  crash — clients drift apart with no error, because nothing here re-validates against a
  replicated layout, only against the seed. See `plunderspell.md` §7 for why this is called out as
  a hard constraint rather than a style preference.
- **A module's rasterised footprint must stay `CellScale`-aligned with its neighbours.** A room
  prefab whose collider doesn't match the grid footprint the generator assumed can pass placement
  but fail path validation (or the reverse), because the two use different representations of the
  same layout.
